Let's get some output:

puts 'Hi there'

Let's look at variables. A variable is a label to which we can assign a value:

pi_number = 3.14
phrase = "Pi is approximately equal to "

puts phrase + pi_number

In addition to single numbers and sentences, we might want to assign a list to a variable:

my_list = ['apples', 'oranges', 'bananas']
some_lucky_numbers = [6, 4, 9]

Let's go loop through the lists and print each item:

puts 'Fruits:'

my_list.each do |fruit|
	puts fruit
end

puts 'Lucky numbers:'

some_lucky_numbers.each do |lucky_number|
	puts lucky_number
end

Let's run some comparisons:

puts 5 > 4

puts 12 == 12

puts 'Apples' == 'Oranges'

puts 'Green' == 'Green'

puts 3 <= 2

Once you can compare, you can respond differently according to information coming in:

name = 'Leslie'

if name == 'Leslie"
	puts 'Hello Leslie'
else
	puts 'Hi there'
end

Much of coding relates to organization. One of the main ways we organize and re-use code is through "functions". Let's define one:

def greeting
	'Hello'
end

puts greeting

Going further, we can define a function with parameters, making them highly re-usable.

def greet(name)
	'Hello ' + name
end

puts greet('Pat')
puts greet('Jordan')


That is pretty much it. Everything builds on top of those ideas.
Variables, Loops, Conditions, Functions
